## Configuation Files
# BASH
My bash customization file  

Set time zone

NOTES:   
* Terminal Preferences runs the .bashrc. .bash_profile works on MacOS, but I wanted all the files named ".bashrc"
* Invocation types
	* login
	* interactive
* When each config file is used
	* ~/.bashrc
		* Used by "screen"
		* Used when non-interactive (e.g., running from a script)
		* Used when interactive and non-login
	* Priority at startup: /etc/profile -> ~/.bash_profile -> ~/.bash_login -> ~/.profile


# VIM
My VIM customization file
